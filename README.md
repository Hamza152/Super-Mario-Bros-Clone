# Super-Mario-Bros-Clone

This is a clone of the legendary NES game Super Mario Bros that I developped with c++ using only Win32 API and "stb_image" to load png images. In addition to the game, the project contains a level editor enabling creation and save of new customized levels. 

The code is divided to two parts, one dedicated to the game, and the other to the editor. You can build the game from "game_code" folder using "build.bat". Created levels are saved in "levels" folder.  

You can find a compiled version of the game inside "build" folder.
Here is a video presentation of game and editor:
